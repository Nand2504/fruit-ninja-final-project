Things I was Able to achieve:

- i was able to achieve the overall concept of the game although the fruits themsleves aren't the best in my opinion
- i was able to create the score board like i wanted
- i was, for the most part, successful in making the game functional and having the cursor be able to cut the fruit What I

wasn't successful in:
- I was not successful in creating different difficulties like I imagines
- although I was able to add the "missed fruits" in the top right corner, I wasn't able to actually make the function work
- because i wasn't able to maked the missed fruits function work I was not able to add a function that would end the game if a certain amount of fruits were missed/not cut
- also because of that, i had wanted to add a jump scare that would pop out of to many fruits were missed but because I wasn't able to get the function working properly in time i was not able to add that into my game

other:
- i enjoyed working on this project because it was fun to try and create a game that i used to play all the time as a kid
- i found myself having to search through youtube, and runestone quite a lot because I wasn't able to figure out how to do certain things which made it very difficult.
